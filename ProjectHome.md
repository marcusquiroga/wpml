**This is a multilingual plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org). It allows a single instance of WP to serve a site in several languages.**

# This site is WPML's developers hub #

If you're building multilingual WP themes, or other plugins that interact with [WPML](http://wpml.org), you've come to the right place.

Here, you'll be able to submit different issues, including ideas for enhancements and bug reports.

# How to submit bugs (so that we can fix them) #

We're all extra busy. That includes both WPML's developers and you.

Reporting bugs shows us that you care. In order for us to be able to address the error you found and fix it, we need some information from you.

Include specific information that we can use to quickly reproduce the problem.

## Good bug report ##

  1. Go to the post edit page.
  1. Click on _add translation_.
  1. Save the translation.
  1. BUG - the original post is gone.

(obviously, this is not a real bug)

You can see that this is something that we can easily follow, reproduce and fix.

Advanced users may also locate the potential source of the bug and include a patch in the issue. This would get the bug handled much faster.

## Bad bug report ##

  1. When I click on save, the post in English disappears!!!
  1. Please help!!! My client is waiting just for this!!! Help!!!

We get it. It's urgent. But, there's not much to work on. See what we mean?
